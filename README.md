This is an algorithm for an advanced code editor that automatically corrects syntax errors in programming languages. It is assumed that we receive a clear specification of the valid syntax of the programming language in the form of a ”rule” and a code fragment that contains syntax errors, i.e., does not conform to that rule.

The objective is to build an algorithm that determines the minimum number of operations required to transform the code fragment into one that complies with the given rule. These operations may include character substitutions, insertions, or deletions.

Let’s take a concrete example to illustrate the problem: let’s assume we have the following syntax rule for function declarations in the programming language:
”Every function must start with the keyword ”func”, followed by the function name enclosed in parentheses.” An example of a valid function declaration would be ”func(myFunction)”.Here’s how the situation looks:
Given code fragment: ”fnuc(myFuncion”
The objective is to find the minimum number of operations required to correct the code fragment so that it matches the pattern defined by the rule. These operations may include, for example, reversing the characters ”n” and ”u” to obtain ”func”, then inserting the missing characters ”t” and ”)”, so that we obtain ”func(myFunc)” according to the given rule.
